Our CLI tool allows you to use Flash Loan Mastery from the command line.

What the CLI can do:

- Initialize flash loan pools
- Deposit tokens into flash loan pools
- Withdraw tokens from flash loan pools
- Run example flash loan instructions
- Arbitrage using our flash loans and [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/)


## Installation

1. [Git Clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) the [CLI repository](https://github.com/moshthepitt/flash-loan-mastery-cli).
2. Install all the dependencies with `yarn`.

```sh
yarn
```
3. Locate or [setup your file system wallet](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/file-system-wallet#:~:text=A%20file%20system%20wallet%20exists,system%20wallet%20is%20not%20recommended.) file.
4. Run `yarn start help` to see all the commands.

```sh
yarn start help
```

You can also run yarn start help command to see what each command is for. e.g.

```sh
yarn start help deposit
```

## Examples

### Init Pool

To get help on this command:

```sh
yarn start help init-pool
```

To set up a new pool:

```sh
yarn start init-pool -k /path/to/solana-wallet.json -tm DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263 -pm EEgkPj5Z4J9KMCFSchiMz9wGusJgw6wqGPMyMJT9hoEZ
```

Note that the `pm` (Pool Mint) option:

- should be a new mint that is owned by the user
- should not have any tokens issued
- should have the same number of decimals as the `tm` (Token Mint) option

Note that a pool for any mint can only bet up once, and this can be done by anyone.

### Deposit

To get help on this command:

```sh
yarn start help deposit
```

For example, to deposit some [BONK](https://twitter.com/bonk_inu):

```sh
yarn start deposit -k /path/to/solana-wallet.json -tm DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263 -tf Hm4ebPskgjJVesKLowyEhpLW6axodBbH82k5CHz3ynSa -a 10310517.49915
```

### Withdraw

To get help on this command:

```sh
yarn start help withdraw
```

For example, to withdraw some USDC:

```sh
yarn start withdraw -k /path/to/solana-wallet.json -tm EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v -ptf 6H7ahCDN8hny2mWKoQBycUqLXoq4aaZ6V32rpmh99eGr -a 4.249834
```

### Example Flash Loan

To get help on this command:

```sh
yarn start help example-flash-loan
```

For example, an example of a flash loan of 10 million BONK:

```sh
yarn start example-flash-loan -k /path/to/solana-wallet.json -tm DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263 -a 10000000
```

[Here is what the transaction itself](https://solana.fm/tx/5wbvKGpQcojidPoAr5Kc8xeJijy2UyYgu3ZrFCDkJL7DHbx4tmPd7wgafL54NMv6oxYDEf6JKw1yAaXYN5hx9f3J?cluster=mainnet-qn1) looks like.  We are fairly certain that this might be the very first BONK flash loan ever! :)

### Example Flash Loan Using Versioned Transactions

We support flash loans using Solana's [versioned transactions](https://docs.solana.com/developing/versioned-transactions).

For example, for a versioned flash loan of 1,000 USDC:

#### 1. Create keys/addresses that should be saved in the address lookup table

```sh
yarn start seed-example-flash-loan-lookup-table -k /path/to/solana-wallet.json -tm EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v -a 1000
```
#### 2. Create the address lookup table

```sh
yarn start create-versioned-flash-loan-lookup-table-from-cache -k /path/to/solana-wallet.json -tm EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v
```

#### 3. Execute the flash loan using versioned transactions

```sh
yarn start example-versioned-flash-loan -k /path/to/solana-wallet.json -tm EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v -a 1000
```

[Here is what this versioned flash loan transaction](https://solana.fm/tx/2utP7HZNCbx3BtZSNuZbpmhDz1Gxbw7h1MygPjvVEo1MQry7VHPqHxevXy5AEYiFkJFsdBMg7vaWXW6iKWz8jmkv?cluster=mainnet-qn1) ends up looking like.
