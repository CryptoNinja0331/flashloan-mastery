The event's gracious judges just made [this announcement](https://twitter.com/LamportDAO/status/1621790616194793473):

> The 2nd place winner of the Bonking with Bonk! track (5B [$BONK](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONK&src=cashtag_click)) sponsored by [@bonk_inu](https://twitter.com/bonk_inu) goes to **Flash Loan Mastery**

As we said in our [hackathon submission](https://discord.com/channels/1033504592383705148/1067008402313711708), we think that Flash Loan Mastery this is the simplest and best Solana flash loan program.  We are glad that others think so as well.

Here's a fun fact: to date, Flash Loan Mastery is the only **award-winning** flash loan program in the Solana ecosystem. Nice, eh? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ”¥

Quick, here is [how you can get started](/about/).
